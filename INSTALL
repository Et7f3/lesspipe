INSTALL
=======
Execute the following commands (for a more detailed description see below):

  ./configure
  cp lesspipe.sh code2color tarcolor vimcolor sxw2txt /usr/local/bin

or if you prefer make:

  make
  make test
  make install

Then do set the environment variable LESSOPEN:

  LESSOPEN="|/usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh %s"; export LESSOPEN  #(sh like shells)
  setenv LESSOPEN "|/usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh %s"            #(csh, tcsh)

  DO NOT OMIT THE VERTICAL BAR AS FIRST CHARACTER, IT IS ESSENTIAL !!!

Detailed description
====================

Prerequisites:
--------------
For a detailed discussion consult the file README starting with the section
'Required programs'. For best results up to date versions of 'file'
tar, gzip, bzip2 and some helper programs are highly recommended.

Step 1: create Makefile and lesspipe.sh using a different shell (optional)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ./configure [--help] [--nomake] [--prefix=<path>] [--shell=<file>]

Options:
  --help                  print this message
  --shell=<filename>      specify full path to an alternative shell to use
  --nomake                do not generate a Makefile
Directory and file names:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install lesspipe.sh in PREFIX/bin (/usr/local)

configure generates by default a Makefile and if an alternate shell is
given, then also a changed lesspipe.sh.

Step 2: verify that lesspipe.sh is working correctly (optional)
---------------------------------------------------------------
A test suite has been added that does cover most use cases of less.
If the test suite reports "NOT ok" lines then lesspipe.sh
is probably not fully functional in your environment. If the message is
"ignored" it is usually an indication that some helper programs are
not installed. To execute the test suite the command

  make test
or
  ./test.pl [-e] [-n] [-v] [testnumber[s]] [file_name]

can be used. The options -e and -v are for debugging.

To get support for newer file types an additional magic file (e.g. ~/.magic,
for use in the file command) might have to be created. In that case the
environment variable MAGIC has to be set and has to contain both the system
magic file and your personal one. Example:

  MAGIC='/usr/share/file/magic:/Users/myaccount/.magic'
  export MAGIC

Step 3: install lesspipe.sh, code2color, vimcolor, sxw2txt and tarcolor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You can copy lesspipe.sh to any appropriate place.
Suggested location: /usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh
The helper programs can be copied to the same directory as lesspipe.sh or any
directory listed in the PATH environment variable.
The tarcolor script allows to colorize tar listings.

  cp lesspipe.sh code2color vimcolor sxw2txt tarcolor /usr/local/bin

This can be achieved also with make:

  make install [PREFIX=<path>]  # that copies the scripts to <path>/bin

Step 4: activate lesspipe.sh
----------------------------
To make use of the installed lesspipe.sh set the environment variable LESSOPEN:
I recommend to use the fully qualified path to avoid problems with other
scripts of the same name or with a changed search PATH:

  LESSOPEN="|/usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh %s"; export LESSOPEN  #(sh like shells)
  setenv LESSOPEN "|/usr/local/bin/lesspipe.sh %s"	      #(csh, tcsh)
